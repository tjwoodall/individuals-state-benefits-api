The Individuals State Benefits API allows a developer to:

- list and retrieve state benefits
- create or amend customer added state benefits
- delete customer added state benefits
- create or amend benefits financial data
- mark a state benefit as ignored

For certain scenarios, a request may not be made for a tax year which has not yet ended. This includes:

- creating, or amending a customer added state benefit
- ignoring a HMRC held state benefit
- amending state benefit amounts for benefit types which are not Job Seekers Allowance (JSA) or Employment Support
  Allowance (ESA)
